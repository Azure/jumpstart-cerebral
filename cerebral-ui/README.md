# Cerebral UI

This is the React app that holds Cerebral UI.

## Pre-requisites

This application requires Node.js and NPM to be installed in order to make it run.

Install Node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current

This installer will also install NPM.

## Develop locally

You can open the `cerebral-ui` folder in VSCode.

## First run

Before running the app, you need to install all the NPM packages it requires.
You can do it by opening a CMD window in the `cerebral-ui` folder and running: `npm install`.

## Starting the app

In order to start, run: `npm start`.
This will start the local development server and launch the app.

## Making changes

You can change the TypeScript files and just save them; the local dev server has hot reload, so it will automatically reload the site.
